# PyGame Workshop Starter Code

In this workshop, we will cover some basics of PyGame and build a simple Dino Game! The game is inspired by the Google Chrome Dino Game, which appears when you are offline.
The objective of the game is to control a dinosaur and avoid obstacles (cacti) while collecting points. The game features basic animations, collision detection, and a scoring system.
